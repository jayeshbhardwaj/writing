Sometimes I can't help but wonder if the things around us are inadvertently trying to show us the
reflection of our lives upon themselves, after all isn't it true that we project our inner selves on
people and things surrounding us. Each of them may choose to reflect an attribute they either like
or are annoyed by, based upon their whim, and then go on to shove it in our faces anytime we are in
their vicinity. It is quite acceptable if you cannot make any sense of what I have been on about, I
can't make much of it either (see that's one aspect my wardrobe likes to project towards me). All I
want to say is this, just this morning as I sat in my chair and was lazily browsing through some
music and then on to some blog articles on medium, I stole a glance at my work desk (that's what I
like to call it even on days when there's minimal or aboslutely no work accomplished upon it) and
noticed something very odd. And that is what I am here to talk about, so forgive the roundabout
introduction I had to weave instead of just getting to the point. It's an old habit actually, hammered
into my brain by my English teachers in school, and has fortunately or unfortunately remained with
me all these years. 

'What's an essay without an introduction?',they used to say, so even when I need to write about
something as trite as annoying American spellings of words (Perhaps you have been mesmerized by it
as well , or mesmerised?) , I would start my essay stating something irrelevant about the
time when pilgrims made their journey across the ocean to this promised land of Columbus.

But let us get back to the thing that captured my imagination this morning, the state of my work
desk. So much so, that it almost felt like an epiphany, just like the times when I am able to finally
decipher the actual lyrics of a song I have liked for long. So here I was, thinking of something
that can be written about, my mind wondering about topics that folks on the internet would like to
hear about, and just about then, my eyes noticed the chaos on display upon my desk. Almost, everything
was in a place where it was not supposed it be, except my laptop hanging around centrally in the eye
of the storm.

The thing to marvel at, for me, was not tha fact that everything seemed in a disarray but I was more
amazed at how it had attained that state after having been cleaned up just the previous morning. And
this reminded me of the steady state concept of physics and in some parts about unstable equilibrium.
Not to get into a full on lecture on physics, but every kind of matter has a steady state associated
with it,
